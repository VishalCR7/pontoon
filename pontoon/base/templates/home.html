        <h1>Here's why localizing Mozilla matters.</h1>
        <p>Mozilla's localization (L10n) objective is to improve the world by culturally adapting Mozilla products by region and offering them to every user throughout the world and create an open web available for everyone beyond all the linguistic, cultural and geographical boundaries.

        This program is a non-profit open source project where we work closely with communities of volunteer contributors who also care about the fate of the open web. Their contributions to our L10n effort make having an open and accessible web possible.

        <b>Working together, we can open the web to all and protect user rights all over the world.</b></p>

    <section class="snaps section-5" data-section-name="section-5">
      <div class="in-context">
        <h1>One more thing.</h1>
        <p>One of the coolest features of Pontoon is localizing web content in-place, with context and spatial limitations right in front of you. The moment you submit translation, it replaces the original text in the web page, making you the first proofreader and tester.

        We made a special demo page for you to understand it better.</p>
